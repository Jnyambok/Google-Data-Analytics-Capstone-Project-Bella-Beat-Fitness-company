The following documentation follows the optional Capstone project provided by the Google Data Analytics Course. It follows through the eight stages of data analysis which are Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.  This Capstone Project was carried out with the help of R programming language, which is a data-centric, accessible language used to organize, modify, clean data frames and create insightful data visualizations. Letâ€™s get into it!

--The BellaBeatCaseStudy_2022.pdf serves as the presentation document of the Case Study detailing all of the steps taken to complete the project.
--The bellabeat_Rcode serves as the R file where all of the analysis was done.
--The dailyActivity.xlsx was the dataset picked out for us



Point to note: This is my first ever case study and I am eager to learn and improve on its simplicityðŸ˜€
